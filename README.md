## **Uninstallation Instructions**

1. Locate the `Updater shortcut`.  
2. Right-click and select `Open File Location`.  
3. Run `unins000.exe` to remove the setup safely.  

- **Important:** Do not use third-party uninstallation software (e.g., _GeekUninstaller_), as it may delete your entire game data.  

### **Additional Notes**

- **Error:** Having multiple `Lua/St` files will cause all of them to be packed into a single `.zip` file.
